# Hi, Iâ€™m Albert. 

I'm a lifelong learner and geek. I enjoy levelling up in real life as much as I enjoy levelling up in RPG video games. 

These are some of my favorite tools:

    * E-Learning: LearnWorlds LMS, Camtasia, Snagit
    * CMS: WordPress and WordPress headless
    * UI/UX: Adobe XD
    * Languages: CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python 
    * Framework: Bootstrap, Gatsby/Atlas 
    * IT: Freshworks, NordVPN, Raspberry Pi, RealVNC, Toggl Track, Zapier
    * Raspberry Pi: Linux scripts and Python scripts
