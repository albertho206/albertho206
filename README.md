# Hi, Iâ€™m Albert. 

I'm a lifelong learner and geek. I enjoy levelling up in real life as much as I enjoy levelling up in RPG video games. 

These are some of my favorite tools:

- CMS: WordPress and WordPress headless
- E-Learning: Learn Worlds LMS, Camtasia, Snagit
- Framework: Bootstrap, Gatsby/Atlas 
- Information Technology: Freshworks, NordVPN, Raspberry Pi, RealVNC, Toggl Track, Zapier
- Languages: CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, Python 
- Raspberry Pi: Linux scripts and Python scripts
- UI/UX: Adobe XD
